# NBA-Predictive-Modeling
STOR 538 - Sports Analytics

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

The primary goal of this project is to use data science methods to design models for 
predicting three different variables–Spread, Total, and OREB (offensive rebounds)–in games 
played by the National Basketball Association (NBA) between March 7 and March 21, 2025. 

Our starting data was obtained from a GitHub repository titled “NBA-Data-2010-2024” 
and created by Vitalii Korolyk. The repository contains various CSV files with NBA data from 
2010 to 2024, with some files providing information related to player statistics and others 
offering insights into team performances and overall game outcomes.

The variables Spread, Total, and OREB were all evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE). Our group ranked 2nd in the Spread category with MAE 11.08, 1st in Total with MAE 13.99, and 7th in OREB with MAE 4.95 out of 14 groups.

If you are interested in the methodology, I have uploaded our final paper to this repository. The paper outlines all of the steps taken in the data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling processes.
